Besides his second-minute penalty for Liverpool FC against Tottenham Hotspur FC in Madrid on 1 June, Egyptian football striker Mo Salah may have also scored a goal against prejudice, according to a new study.
On the pitch, Salah often celebrates goals by dropping to his knees and touching his forehead to the grass in the sujood (an Islamic prayer position), while Liverpool fans have a chant that goes: “If he scores another few, then I’ll be Muslim, too”. 
But the Salah effect is having an impact beyond the stadium walls, say researchers from Stanford University, who found a drop in hate crimes around Liverpool since Salah signed with the club in June 2017.
The report examined data from police departments around England, including Merseyside, the UK county in which Liverpool is located. It found hate crimes there were “significantly lower” - dropping by 18.9% since Salah joined the club - than would be otherwise expected.
“The observed decrease is larger in Merseyside than in all placebo counties, suggesting the result is not merely due to chance,” wrote the researchers. They noted that the trend has not coincided with a general decline in crime: “There is a larger relative decline in hate crimes than in any other crime category.”
Not only that, but after studying 15 million tweets by UK football fans, the researchers found Liverpool supporters had halved the number of anti-Muslim tweets they were posting. 
The Salah effect
Islamophobia – or anti-Muslim racism – has been on the rise in the UK since the 9/11 attacks in New York in 2001, according to think-tank Runnymede Trust. There are generally spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes  between 24 to 72 hours after a terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists, such as the attack at Westminster in London in March 2017.
As the above YouGov chart shows, the percentage of the UK public that views Islam as culturally at odds with British values increased sharply between 2015 and 2017, with more than half of respondents agreeing with the sentiment.
In the Stanford study, a survey of more than 8,000 Liverpool fans suggested the reason for the reduction in prejudice towards Muslims in Merseyside was because Salah was familiarizing his fans with Islam, through his observation of the faith, while his image as a bubbly father, friend and fantastic footballer was breaking down stereotypes of “threatening Muslims”.
Through his now-famous goal celebration, his social media posts, his pitch-side interviews and seeing his wife Magi cheering him in a veil, Salah’s fans have been invited into his public and private lives.
“These findings suggest that positive exposure to outgroup celebrities can reveal new and humanizing information about the group at large, reducing prejudiced attitudes and behaviours," the researchers concluded.
And they hope the Salah effect will offer up “new potential avenues for building social cohesion around the globe”.
Salah was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2019, described by HBO host John Oliver as, “A humble, thoughtful, funny man who isn’t taking any of this too seriously”.
Perhaps the last word should go to his Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, who praised the athlete's recognition in Time, noting, “Mo is a very smart person and his role is very influential. In the world at the moment, it is very important that you have people like Mo.”

Egyptian soccer superstar Mohamed Salah has called on men in his country and across the Muslim world to treat women with more respect.
In an interview with TIME, the Liverpool striker spoke frankly for the first time about the importance of women’s equality. “I think we need to change the way we treat women in our culture,” Salah said. “It’s not optional.”
He said seeing how women were treated “in my culture and in the Middle East” had changed the way he thought about gender relations. “I support the woman more than I did before, because I feel like she deserves more than what they give her now, at the moment.”
After leading his country to the FIFA World Cup in 2018 for the first time in 28 years, Salah has become an icon in Egypt and across the region. In the interview, he said soccer fans in the Middle East “feel like I’m their son.”
Salah, 26, admitted there was a “little bit of pressure” that came with being a role model, but also that it made him “proud” and pushed him to be a better soccer player. “To be the first Egyptian in [this] situation and no one has done this before … it’s something different,” he said.
His favorite way to unwind after a game, he said, is spending time with his 5-year-old daughter, and being one of the top players in world football hasn’t changed his lifestyle. “I just live my life normal,” he said. “Most of the time I stay at home, I don’t like to go out.”
Salah was named in the 2019 TIME 100 list of the world’s most influential people, and appears on one of the issue’s six covers. Inside, Liverpool fan and HBO star John Oliver pays tribute to the soccer player as an “iconic figure for Egyptians, Scousers and Muslims the world over.”

Salah went into Liverpool’s showdown with Chelsea with the weight of expectation on his shoulders thanks to his immense goalscoring exploits for the Reds.
But the approach to the hotly-anticipated Premier League clash had been overshadowed this week after a small group of Chelsea fans were filmed singing a sick chant about the Egyptian.
Salah’s Islamic faith was referred to in a racist manner in the horrific song, which has since been widely criticised and prompted the Blues to take action against the supporters involved.
Mohamed Salah did his talking on the pitch, doubling Liverpool’s lead after Sadio Mane had scored with a screamer that Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had no chance of stopping.
The former Chelsea ace seemed to make a point of hitting back at the fans who had criticised him by praying as part of a poignant celebration in front of the Kop.
Salah closed his eyes as he stood on just his right leg and put his hands together in what is universally recognised as a praying gesture.
Liverpool fans took to social media after seeing the 26-year-old's celebration, hailing the way he reacted to bagging following this week's furore.
"That celebration from Salah after the racist video this week was beautiful, what a player," said one supporter.
  
  
  
Another wrote: "That new Salah celebration hard though."
A third quipped: "Can we take a minute to appreciate this celebration."
A fourth fan reckoned Salah was sending a message of peace to his detractors among the Chelsea faithful.
They said: "Salah’s celebration meant peace btw."
  
Sky Sports commentator Martin Tyler hailed Salah’s incredible goal, which handed Liverpool a stranglehold on the game that they did not give up.
"[Kepa] did well to see it," Tyler said.
"He had no chance of reaching it, a blockbuster.
"The Egyptian King with a regal moment here at Anfield and 0-0 has become 2-0 in a blink of an eye."

The Reds claimed an emphatic 5-0 win over the already-relegated Terriers at Anfield and led after just 15 seconds through Naby Keita
Braces for Sadio Mane and Mo Salah strengthened the pair’s respective Golden Boot hopes as Klopp’s side secured an emphatic win that puts them on 91 points for the season with two games remaining.
Liverpool’s win was their 10th successive across all competitions and marks their best run of victories since 11 consecutive triumphs in May 2006.
The Merseyside outfit are also 19 matches unbeaten across all competitions, their longest such streak for 23 years, as they at least temporarily moved back to the top of the league ahead of title rivals Manchester City.
But Liverpool were without star forward Roberto Firmino against Huddersfield, after rumours circulated on Twitter leading up to the game that the Brazilian would be ruled out for the rest of the season due to injury.
Klopp, however, delivered a firm response to such speculation and also dismissed claims of a fall-out with Salah after recent reports that the duo’s relationship had suddenly broken down.
The German told BBC Sport: “Wow! I always tell you, don’t believe three per-cent of what is on social media!
“Let’s start with that, I had no argument with Mo Salah. Especially not after the Chelsea game. I have no clue why that should have happened. 
  
  
  
 Don’t believe three per-cent of what is on social media!
Jurgen Klopp
“And Roberto Firmino is not out for the rest of the season. 
“It’s true yesterday, after training, he fell obviously a little bit, he went to the physiotherapist and they wanted to wait overnight. 
“This morning he came and said he still feels it a little bit. It’s kind of a small tear. We will see. 
“It’s Bobby Firmino, so I would say it’s likely he’s ready for Barcelona. Of course we don’t know 100 per-cent. 
“It’s not too long a time. Like I said, it’s Bobby and he’s a machine. We will see. We will take no risk of course. 
  
“It’s good that we showed that it works without him as well.”
Klopp also expanded on Firmino in his post-match press conference, reiterating his confidence he will be back for Liverpool’s Champions League semi-final first leg against Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Wednesday (8pm).
He added: “The official diagnosis is that he has a small tear in a very small muscle. Apart from the word 'tear' everything is positive.
“It's Bobby, so he might be ready for Wednesday but we don't know obviously at the moment.
“But because it's him, it's rather likely than not. But we will see. Of all the bad news we could get, it's probably the best. But it's still bad enough that he couldn't play tonight.”

Egyptian talisman Mo Salah scored his first goal of the tournament as the hosts beat DR Congo to qualify from Group A. Earlier, German coach Gernot Rohr's Nigeria also made it to the last-16 after beating Guinea.


Group A: Egypt 2-0 DR Congo (Elmohamady 25', Salah 43')
Egypt and Mo Salah advanced to the last-16 of the Africa Cup of Nations after a 2-0 win over DR Congo made it two wins from two for the hosts. 
Underdogs Congo were the brighter team for long periods in the first half and the Leopards even hit the woodwork twice, first when Wolfsburg defender Marcel Tisserand stabbed onto the bar from close range and then when Jonathan Bolingi's header looped onto the frame of the goal.
At the other end however, Egypt were more clinical. When a corner kick fell to Ahmed Elmohamady in a crowded penalty area, the Aston Villa defender skillfully flicked the ball from his left foot to his right before poking it home to give the Pharos the lead.
And when the influential Trezeguet  drove through midfield to set up Salah, the Liverpool man made up for an earlier miss as he wrong-footed both his marker and the goalkeeper to fire home his first goal of the tournament, much to the delight of the 60,000 fans packed into the Cairo International Stadium.
Congo continued to pile on the pressure in the second half but failed to convert their dominant spells into goals, although Bolingi did force Ahmed El Shenawy into an impressive reflex save while Yannick Bolasie curled a free-kick just inches wide.
At the other end, Trezeguet found the side-netting for Egypt but the score remained 2-0.
Group B: Nigeria 1-0 Guinea (Omeruo, 73')
Nigeria became the first team to qualify for the knock-out stages following a 1-0 win over Guinea in Group B.
Former Chelsea defender Kenneth Omeruo (above) scored the only goal of the game, breaking the deadlock for the Super Eagles with 17 minutes remaining as German coach Gernot Rohr's team maintained their 100 percent record.
Guinea, with Borussia Mönchengladbach's Ibrahima Traore and former RB Leipzig star Naby Keita, are third in the group behind Madagascar and are far from certain to qualify ahead of matchday three.
Keita, making his first start for either his country or his current club Liverpool since 1 May, was far from match-fit and was substituted just before Nigeria took the lead.
With the tournament having been expanded to 24 teams, the top two from each of the six groups will also be joined by the four best third-placed teams in the last-16.
With qualification secured, three-time tournament winners Nigeria are now hoping for a resolution to a row over bonuses before the next round. None of the players had received their $10,000 bonus payments or their allowances ahead of the game against Guinea but, according to the BBC, the players expect to be paid on Friday.
Khama Billiat rescued a point for Zimbabwe against Uganda
Group A: Uganda 1-1 Zimbabwe (Okwi 12' - Billiat 40')
Uganda played out an entertaining draw with Zimbabwe in Cairo to temporarily go top of Group A— ahead of group favorites Egypt's later game against DR Congo.
Zimbabwe's Khama Billiat canceled out Emmanuel Okwi's early opener for Uganda to leave the sides level at the break. In the second half, both teams missed gilt-edged chances to take the lead.
First, Zimbabwe's Knowledge Musona left everyone confused after somehow contriving to hit the bar just four yards from an empty goal, before Uganda's Patrick Kaddu also missed an open goal, volleying over from just six yards.
Zimbabwe's wait for a first win at the Africa Cup of Nations since 2006 goes on.

Senegal became the first side to book their place in the Africa Cup of Nations 2019 semifinals courtesy of a 1-0 win over Benin, while Nigeria overcame South Africa thanks to a last-gasp winner. 
Host nation Egypt made it three wins out of three in Group A, beating Uganda who finised as group runners up. Elsewhere, Madagascar caused the biggest upset of the tournament so far by beating Nigeria to top Group B 
From leaving the pitch in tears to being touted as a Ballon d'Or contender, the turn of the year did wonders for Sadio Mane. With Senegal chasing a first AFCON title, 2019 isn't over yet though.

The Egyptian was named as one of the top 100 most influential people by TIME Magazine last week.
To celebrate the credible achievement, the 26-year-old was invited out to New York to attend a celebratory gala.
Salah was in good company on the list alongside the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Nelson Mandela, George Clooney and Bill Gates.
Singers Taylor Swift and Khalid performed at the awards, as the Liverpool winger enjoyed some downtime away from the pressure of the Premier League title race.
He was pictured alongside comedian Jimmy Fallon, Game of Thrones actor Emilia Clarke as well as the award-winning Rami Malek.
Despite being born in Los Angeles, his parents are Egyptian meaning the snap of the duo received huge engagement on social media from fans.
The forward will now return to England and rejoin his team-mates at Melwood as they prepare for the visit of Huddersfield on Friday night.
Jurgen Klopp’s troops will be tuned in for tonight’s Manchester derby between Manchester United and Manchester City.
  
  
  
  
Anything other than a City win would be a fantastic would see Liverpool’s fate in their hands with three games left to play.
Kop boss Klopp recently praised Salah for not only his performances on the pitch, but also his attitude off it where he is leading the way in the battle against Islamaphobia.
“He’s a role model in so many different things,” said Klopp.
“It’s really, really nice to have him, and Sadio Mane as well.
 When in NYC... eat like you’re in Rome ������
A post shared by  Mohamed Salah (@mosalah) on Apr 23, 2019 at 1:09pm PDT
  
“Both are Muslims and live that, in a world where these things are very often discussed in a dangerous manner, where people think, ‘They are all like this’ or ‘They are all like that’.
“We know that’s not true, but it is nice to have somebody around full of joy, full of love and to do what he is doing around his religion.”
Despite missing out on the PFA Player of the Year award shortlist, Salah remains neck-and-neck with Sergio Aguero and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the race for the Golden Boot with 19 goals.
Liverpool have just five games left to play this season, with a potential for six should they reach the Champions League final in Madrid.

Salah, the 26-year-old forward, who won the Premier League Golden Boot after scoring 32 goals last season is depicted in his trademark celebration with his arms out wide.
However, that is where the favourable characteristics end. His arms, legs and torso appear disproportionately smaller when compared with the size of his head.
Observers on social media have likened the statue to Home Alone villain Marv and 1970s singer Art Garfunkel.
One twitter user wrote: “Once you've seen it you can't unsee it. Mo Salah's statue is a dead ringer for Marv.”
Once you've seen it you can't unsee it. Mo Salah's statue is a dead ringer for Marv. pic.twitter.com/CCNyU1rEzW
Another user said: “What is it with footballers and statues?”
The sculpture is set to join an unwanted list of artwork that has left fans bemused, most famously Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo had a statue created at Madeira airport in Portugal last year that was widely ridiculed.
The heavy criticism resulted in the statue being taken down and sculptor Emanuel Santos had to modify the work to reflect the Portuguese superstar.
Egyptian sculptor Mai Abdel Allah who came up with the idea of a Salah artwork in 2016, has defended her work describing it as "distinguished and executable”.
Why does the statue of @MoSalah look more like #ArtGarfunkel? pic.twitter.com/wFd7dNulrC
  
She added that she had learned to take criticism with “politeness and respect”.
The ‘Egyptian King’ won the PFA player of the season last year and led Liverpool to the UEFA Champions League final.
Born in Nagrig in northern Egypt, Salah enjoys widespread popularity in his home country helping them to qualify for this summers World cup for the first time in 28 years.
The artwork was put on display on Sunday at the World Youth Forum in Sharm al-Sheikh.

The Egyptian has become a hero at Anfield since arriving on Merseyside nearly two years ago.
But now according to Spanish outlet AS, he is determined to force his way out of the club this summer.
The reports claim that Salah has asked the Premier League leaders to sanction his sale at the end of the season.
It comes as a result of a series of heated discussions with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, the newspaper claim.
The Egyptian is even willing to hand in a transfer request to force through a move, it's claimed.
Salah penned a new bumper five-year contract with the Reds last summer on the back of a record-breaking season at the club.
On his way to winning the PFA Player of the Year he struck 32 times in the Premier League, the highest number of goals ever in a single campaign.
He also helped Liverpool reach the Champions League final in Kiev where he injured his shoulder in a tangle with Sergio Ramos.
Real Madrid will be only one of a few clubs around the world that will be able to afford his price tag, should he be allowed to leave Liverpool.
  
  
  
A big indication of whether these reports are true will be whether the forward starts for the Reds tonight in Porto.
Liverpool take a 2-0 advantage to the Estadio do Dragao as they bid to reach the semi-finals where they would meet Barcelona.
Salah has returned to form ahead of the run-in having struck two impressive goals in the Reds last two Premier League matches.
That included a 25-year stunner past Kepa Arrizabalaga during Sunday’s 2-0 win over former club Chelsea at Anfield.
  
He is now level with Sergio Aguero at the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 19.
Salah took the chance to explain his celebration which was a major talking point during the win that put them two points clear at the top of the table.
“I am a yoga man! I do yoga and it just came into my mind," Salah told Sky Sports.
“Normally I shoot with the inside of my foot. But this one I decided, because it was far, to hit it with power. I was lucky the ball hit the net like that."
  
Salah’s agent Ramy Abbas Issa didn’t take long to shut down the reports.
He tweeted: “Talking out of their AS again I see.”
Liverpool’s stance surrounding Salah is clear, they see him as one of their most prized assets and they want him to help them win trophies.

Football star Mo Salah has spoken out against plans in his home nation of Egypt to export stray animals abroad, amid fears they will be used for food. 
"Cats and dogs will not be exported anywhere. This won't happen and can't happen," he tweeted, alongside images of his pet cats.
Animal rights activists reacted with anger over the decision, with many calling for the practice to end.
Stray cats and dogs are widespread in Egypt's streets.
The row began after it was reported last week that Egypt's agriculture ministry had approved the exportation of about 4,000 cats and dogs abroad. 
Last Wednesday, private Egyptian newspaper al-Masry al-Youm said the ministry had started issuing health certificates to begin the export process for about 2,400 cats and 1,600 dogs. 
A day later, a ministry spokesperson told Egyptian TenTV channel that the animals had been vaccinated against diseases and would be flown out in accordance with legal procedures.
The authorities did not explain which countries they were being sent to, or for what purpose.
Liverpool and Egypt forward Salah, who enjoys widespread popularity in his home country and the wider Middle East region, entered the debate on Tuesday, tweeting with the hashtag "no to animal rights violations".
لن يتم تصدير القطط والكلاب لأي مكان.. هذا لن يحدث ولا يمكن أن يحدث #لا_لانتهاك_حقوق_الحيوانات pic.twitter.com/9YHozXnqf7
End of Twitter post  by @MoSalah
And many have applauded his input online.
Thanks for speaking up for the voiceless... animals in Egypt are in desperate need for loved public figures like you to raise awareness
End of Twitter post  by @radwa_rabie
Some responded with images of their own pets, using the same hashtag:
عشت يا صلاح👏🏼😍#لا_لانتهاك_حقوق_الحيوانات pic.twitter.com/dKmfrYzTIM
End of Twitter post  by @emanserag
But others argued that Egyptians had bigger things to worry about, with one person suggesting: "Let's look at human rights first, then we can look into animal rights."

Meanwhile, some questioned the viewpoints of those who eat meat but have also joined the campaign against the export of animals:
#اوقفوا_تصدير_الكلاب_والقطط_من_مصر  seriously this shows how much of hypocrites we are. you guys eat meat.....
End of Twitter post  by @thedilemma_
Last month, politician Margaret Azir caused a stir when she suggested the authorities should fatten up stray dogs and export them abroad as a means to deal with the increasing numbers of strays on the streets of Egypt.
She told privately-owned newspaper Youm7 website that in some places, dogs were "as valuable as sheep".
On Friday, the Egyptian authorities denied that the government itself would be exporting any animals - and said that they were only granting the licences for the controversial move.
Spokesman Hamed Abdel Dayem told al-Hadath al-Youm that reports the animals were being transported to countries that will eat them were "baseless".
However, another MP, Nadia Henry, has already submitted a request to parliament to draft a bill which would criminalise the export of dogs and cats.
