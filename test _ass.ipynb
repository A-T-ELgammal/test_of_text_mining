      "Besides his second-minute penalty for Liverpool FC against Tottenham Hotspur FC in Madrid on 1 June, Egyptian football striker Mo Salah may have also scored a goal against prejudice, according to a new study.\n",
      "On the pitch, Salah often celebrates goals by dropping to his knees and touching his forehead to the grass in the sujood (an Islamic prayer position), while Liverpool fans have a chant that goes: “If he scores another few, then I’ll be Muslim, too”. \n",
      "But the Salah effect is having an impact beyond the stadium walls, say researchers from Stanford University, who found a drop in hate crimes around Liverpool since Salah signed with the club in June 2017.\n",
      "The report examined data from police departments around England, including Merseyside, the UK county in which Liverpool is located. It found hate crimes there were “significantly lower” - dropping by 18.9% since Salah joined the club - than would be otherwise expected.\n",
      "“The observed decrease is larger in Merseyside than in all placebo counties, suggesting the result is not merely due to chance,” wrote the researchers. They noted that the trend has not coincided with a general decline in crime: “There is a larger relative decline in hate crimes than in any other crime category.”\n",
      "Not only that, but after studying 15 million tweets by UK football fans, the researchers found Liverpool supporters had halved the number of anti-Muslim tweets they were posting. \n",
      "The Salah effect\n",
      "Islamophobia – or anti-Muslim racism – has been on the rise in the UK since the 9/11 attacks in New York in 2001, according to think-tank Runnymede Trust. There are generally spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes  between 24 to 72 hours after a terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists, such as the attack at Westminster in London in March 2017.\n",
      "As the above YouGov chart shows, the percentage of the UK public that views Islam as culturally at odds with British values increased sharply between 2015 and 2017, with more than half of respondents agreeing with the sentiment.\n",
      "In the Stanford study, a survey of more than 8,000 Liverpool fans suggested the reason for the reduction in prejudice towards Muslims in Merseyside was because Salah was familiarizing his fans with Islam, through his observation of the faith, while his image as a bubbly father, friend and fantastic footballer was breaking down stereotypes of “threatening Muslims”.\n",
      "Through his now-famous goal celebration, his social media posts, his pitch-side interviews and seeing his wife Magi cheering him in a veil, Salah’s fans have been invited into his public and private lives.\n",
      "“These findings suggest that positive exposure to outgroup celebrities can reveal new and humanizing information about the group at large, reducing prejudiced attitudes and behaviours,\" the researchers concluded.\n",
      "And they hope the Salah effect will offer up “new potential avenues for building social cohesion around the globe”.\n",
      "Salah was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2019, described by HBO host John Oliver as, “A humble, thoughtful, funny man who isn’t taking any of this too seriously”.\n",
      "Perhaps the last word should go to his Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, who praised the athlete's recognition in Time, noting, “Mo is a very smart person and his role is very influential. In the world at the moment, it is very important that you have people like Mo.”\n",

      "Egyptian soccer superstar Mohamed Salah has called on men in his country and across the Muslim world to treat women with more respect.\n",
      "In an interview with TIME, the Liverpool striker spoke frankly for the first time about the importance of women’s equality. “I think we need to change the way we treat women in our culture,” Salah said. “It’s not optional.”\n",
      "He said seeing how women were treated “in my culture and in the Middle East” had changed the way he thought about gender relations. “I support the woman more than I did before, because I feel like she deserves more than what they give her now, at the moment.”\n",
      "After leading his country to the FIFA World Cup in 2018 for the first time in 28 years, Salah has become an icon in Egypt and across the region. In the interview, he said soccer fans in the Middle East “feel like I’m their son.”\n",
      "Salah, 26, admitted there was a “little bit of pressure” that came with being a role model, but also that it made him “proud” and pushed him to be a better soccer player. “To be the first Egyptian in [this] situation and no one has done this before … it’s something different,” he said.\n",
      "His favorite way to unwind after a game, he said, is spending time with his 5-year-old daughter, and being one of the top players in world football hasn’t changed his lifestyle. “I just live my life normal,” he said. “Most of the time I stay at home, I don’t like to go out.”\n",
      "Salah was named in the 2019 TIME 100 list of the world’s most influential people, and appears on one of the issue’s six covers. Inside, Liverpool fan and HBO star John Oliver pays tribute to the soccer player as an “iconic figure for Egyptians, Scousers and Muslims the world over.”\n",

      "Salah went into Liverpool’s showdown with Chelsea with the weight of expectation on his shoulders thanks to his immense goalscoring exploits for the Reds.\n",
      "But the approach to the hotly-anticipated Premier League clash had been overshadowed this week after a small group of Chelsea fans were filmed singing a sick chant about the Egyptian.\n",
      "Salah’s Islamic faith was referred to in a racist manner in the horrific song, which has since been widely criticised and prompted the Blues to take action against the supporters involved.\n",
      "Mohamed Salah did his talking on the pitch, doubling Liverpool’s lead after Sadio Mane had scored with a screamer that Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had no chance of stopping.\n",
      "The former Chelsea ace seemed to make a point of hitting back at the fans who had criticised him by praying as part of a poignant celebration in front of the Kop.\n",
      "Salah closed his eyes as he stood on just his right leg and put his hands together in what is universally recognised as a praying gesture.\n",
      "Liverpool fans took to social media after seeing the 26-year-old's celebration, hailing the way he reacted to bagging following this week's furore.\n",
      "\"That celebration from Salah after the racist video this week was beautiful, what a player,\" said one supporter.\n",

      "They said: \"Salah’s celebration meant peace btw.\"\n",
      "  \n",
      "Sky Sports commentator Martin Tyler hailed Salah’s incredible goal, which handed Liverpool a stranglehold on the game that they did not give up.\n",

      "Braces for Sadio Mane and Mo Salah strengthened the pair’s respective Golden Boot hopes as Klopp’s side secured an emphatic win that puts them on 91 points for the season with two games remaining.\n",
      "Liverpool’s win was their 10th successive across all competitions and marks their best run of victories since 11 consecutive triumphs in May 2006.\n",
      "The Merseyside outfit are also 19 matches unbeaten across all competitions, their longest such streak for 23 years, as they at least temporarily moved back to the top of the league ahead of title rivals Manchester City.\n",
      "But Liverpool were without star forward Roberto Firmino against Huddersfield, after rumours circulated on Twitter leading up to the game that the Brazilian would be ruled out for the rest of the season due to injury.\n",

      "Egypt and Mo Salah advanced to the last-16 of the Africa Cup of Nations after a 2-0 win over DR Congo made it two wins from two for the hosts. \n",
      "Underdogs Congo were the brighter team for long periods in the first half and the Leopards even hit the woodwork twice, first when Wolfsburg defender Marcel Tisserand stabbed onto the bar from close range and then when Jonathan Bolingi's header looped onto the frame of the goal.\n",
      "At the other end however, Egypt were more clinical. When a corner kick fell to Ahmed Elmohamady in a crowded penalty area, the Aston Villa defender skillfully flicked the ball from his left foot to his right before poking it home to give the Pharos the lead.\n",
      "And when the influential Trezeguet  drove through midfield to set up Salah, the Liverpool man made up for an earlier miss as he wrong-footed both his marker and the goalkeeper to fire home his first goal of the tournament, much to the delight of the 60,000 fans packed into the Cairo International Stadium.\n",
      "Congo continued to pile on the pressure in the second half but failed to convert their dominant spells into goals, although Bolingi did force Ahmed El Shenawy into an impressive reflex save while Yannick Bolasie curled a free-kick just inches wide.\n",
      "At the other end, Trezeguet found the side-netting for Egypt but the score remained 2-0.\n",
      "Group B: Nigeria 1-0 Guinea (Omeruo, 73')\n",
      "Nigeria became the first team to qualify for the knock-out stages following a 1-0 win over Guinea in Group B.\n",
      "Former Chelsea defender Kenneth Omeruo (above) scored the only goal of the game, breaking the deadlock for the Super Eagles with 17 minutes remaining as German coach Gernot Rohr's team maintained their 100 percent record.\n",
      "Guinea, with Borussia Mönchengladbach's Ibrahima Traore and former RB Leipzig star Naby Keita, are third in the group behind Madagascar and are far from certain to qualify ahead of matchday three.\n",
      "Keita, making his first start for either his country or his current club Liverpool since 1 May, was far from match-fit and was substituted just before Nigeria took the lead.\n",
      "With the tournament having been expanded to 24 teams, the top two from each of the six groups will also be joined by the four best third-placed teams in the last-16.\n",
      "With qualification secured, three-time tournament winners Nigeria are now hoping for a resolution to a row over bonuses before the next round. None of the players had received their $10,000 bonus payments or their allowances ahead of the game against Guinea but, according to the BBC, the players expect to be paid on Friday.\n",

for Liverpool FC against Tottenham Hotspur FC in Madrid on 1 June, Egyptian football striker Mo Salah may have also scored a goal against prejudice, according to a new study.', 'On the pitch, Salah often celebrates goals by dropping to his knees and touching his forehead to the grass in the sujood (an Islamic prayer position), while Liverpool fans have a chant that goes: â€œIf he scores another few, then Iâ€™ll be Muslim, tooâ€\\u200c.', 'But the Salah effect is having an impact beyond the stadium walls, say researchers from Stanford University, who found a drop in hate crimes around Liverpool since Salah signed with the club in June 2017.', 'The report examined data from police departments around England, including Merseyside, the UK county in which Liverpool is located.', 'It found hate crimes there were â€œsignificantly lowerâ€\\u200c - dropping by 18.9% since Salah joined the club - than would be otherwise expected.', 'â€œThe observed decrease is larger in Merseyside than in all placebo counties, suggesting the result is not merely due to chance,â€\\u200c wrote the researchers.', 'They noted that the trend has not coincided with a general decline in crime: â€œThere is a larger relative decline in hate crimes than in any other crime category.â€\\u200c\\nNot only that, but after studying 15 million tweets by UK football fans, the researchers found Liverpool supporters had halved the number of anti-Muslim tweets they were posting.', 'The Salah effect\\nIslamophobia â€“ or anti-Muslim racism â€“ has been on the rise in the UK since the 9/11 attacks in New York in 2001, according to think-tank Runnymede Trust.', 'There are generally spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes  between 24 to 72 hours after a terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists, such as the attack at Westminster in London in March 2017.', 'As the above YouGov chart shows, the percentage of the UK public that views Islam as culturally at odds with British values increased sharply between 2015 and 2017, with more than half of respondents agreeing with the sentiment.', 'In the Stanford study, a survey of more than 8,000 Liverpool fans suggested the reason for the reduction in prejudice towards Muslims in Merseyside was because Salah was familiarizing his fans with Islam, through his observation of the faith, while his image as a bubbly father, friend and fantastic footballer was breaking down stereotypes of â€œthreatening Muslimsâ€\\u200c.', 'Through his now-famous goal celebration, his social media posts, his pitch-side interviews and seeing his wife Magi cheering him in a veil, Salahâ€™s fans have been invited into his public and private lives.', 'â€œThese findings suggest that positive exposure to outgroup celebrities can reveal new and humanizing information about the group at large, reducing prejudiced attitudes and behaviours,\" the researchers concluded.', 'And they hope the Salah effect will offer up â€œnew potential avenues for building social cohesion around the globeâ€\\u200c.', 'Salah was named one of Time magazineâ€™s 100 most influential people of 2019, described by HBO host John Oliver as, â€œA humble, thoughtful, funny man who isnâ€™t taking any of this too seriouslyâ€\\u200c.', \"Perhaps the last word should go to his Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, who praised the athlete's recognition in Time,

in his country and across the Muslim world to treat women with more respect.', 'In an interview with TIME, the Liverpool striker spoke frankly for the first time about the importance of womenâ€™s equality.', 'â€œI think we need to change the way we treat women in our culture,â€\\u200c Salah said.', 'â€œItâ€™s not optional.â€\\u200c\\nHe said seeing how women were treated â€œin my culture and in the Middle Eastâ€\\u200c had changed the way he thought about gender relations.', 'â€œI support the woman more than I did before, because I feel like she deserves more than what they give her now, at the moment.â€\\u200c\\nAfter leading his country to the FIFA World Cup in 2018 for the first time in 28 years, Salah has become an icon in Egypt and across the region.', 'In the interview, he said

â€œproudâ€\\u200c and pushed him to be a better soccer player.', 'â€œTo be the first Egyptian in [this] situation and no one has done this before â€¦ itâ€™s something different,â€\\u200c he said.', 'His favorite way to unwind after a game, he said, is spending time with his 5-year-old daughter, and being one of the top players in world football hasnâ€™t changed his lifestyle.', 'â€œI just live my life normal,â€\\u200c he said.', 'â€œMost of the time I stay at home, I donâ€™t like to go out.â€\\u200c\\nSalah was named in the 2019 TIME 100 list of the worldâ€™s most influential people, and

the Reds.', 'But the approach to the hotly-anticipated Premier League clash had been overshadowed this week after a small group of Chelsea fans were filmed singing a sick chant about the Egyptian.', 'Salahâ€™s Islamic faith was referred to in a racist manner in the horrific song, which has since been widely criticised and prompted the Blues to take action against the supporters involved.', 'Mohamed Salah did his talking on the pitch, doubling Liverpoolâ€™s lead after Sadio Mane had scored with a screamer that Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had no chance of stopping.', 'The former Chelsea ace seemed to make a point of hitting back at the fans who had criticised him by praying as part of a poignant celebration in front of the Kop.', 'Salah closed his eyes as he stood on just his
